/**
 * This UserSignInLog table is to be used with OAuth service which agree to hold a tracing variable for you (such as "state" variable of Facebook).
 * Each time user is about to sign-in, create a record in UserSignInTable to hold your configuration variables, this record is uniquely identifiable by the returned hash.
 * During the sign-in process, user will be redirected to OAuth service page of the service provider, all of your variables will be lost except one or more dedicated variable
 * that OAuth service agreed to pass on such as the "state" in Facebook OAuth. Use this "state" variable to store the hash, once sign-process is finished and user is redirected
 * back to your page, use the hash (stored in "state") to retrieve back your configuration variables (which were setup earlier).
